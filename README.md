Midterm Project: Directory for Tulane Undergraduate Housing Issues

# Project Description 
This project is a resource that provides information for undergraduate students living in Tulane on-campus housing. The program has two classes (InformationCenter and Housing Directory). Each class has its own specific information and resources. When you run the program, it asks you which directory you would like to use (housing or info). After selecting a directory, you can enter different keywords for issues you are having, the name of a dorm for which you want the security desk phone number, or the email address, address, and hours of the central office. The user can continue to enter keywords until they enter 'exit' in the terminal. 

# Features 
- Feature 1: two classes (InformationCenter and Housing Directory)
- Feature 2: if the keyword entered does not match any in the program, the program will suggest a list of possible keywords
- Feature 3: add a keyword by entering 'add' (you will be prompted to enter the keyword and response)
- Feature 4: enter 'back' to go back and switch the directory being used
- Feature 5: enter 'exit' to exit the program
- feature 6: if you enter a part of the keyword/phrase and not the whole phrase, the program will still recognize it and give you a response

# Prerequisites 
Use Python 3.5 to run this code.
